# <nosql-Social-Network-API>

## Description

This week's challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends‚Äô thoughts, and create a friend list. You‚Äôll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

- The motivation this week was working with MongoDb and successfully create a document.

- The project was built to be able to create a document thorugh MongoDb utilizing Mongoose ODM that contains a User model and a Thought model and both files have routes to get all, single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data, a single thought by its `_id`, create a user+thought, update an user + thought, and delete a user (and friend) + thought (and reaction).

- The problem we are trying to solve is to successfully navigate mongodb to not only create sucessful documents, but sucessful routes and make sure we can access the data we are trying to fetch.

- I learned that I really enjoy working with MongoDb, the data is more readable and although complex, it can be easier to work with than previous databases. I paid close attention to the information in each file as I was trying to seed the data and information and I was able to refer back to previous material to organize my data and seed the document. I was happy to see that I was able to accomplish my goal and try out my routes. The same approach was applied to trying out the routes, taking the time out to examine what was not working, and knowing where the mistake could be located was a big step in the right direction for me.

- Once cloned, make sure the packages are in order. We are using mongo, mongoose and Express for this project.
- Perform a npm install to make sure everything is up to date.
- Run the Server with node server.js
- This projects utilizes both MongoDb and Insomnia to test out routes. Insomnia is optional, but optimal if you are just focused on the success of the routes.
